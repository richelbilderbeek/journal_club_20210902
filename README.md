```
(IMO) a valuable, shin-kicking perspective from @callie_h_burt
 and @MarcusMunafo
 – GWAS needs to be transparent and justified in reporting its methods and the reasoning behind them.

#PLOSBiology: Has GWAS lost its status as a paragon of open science?

> While numerous phenotypic traits clearly have a heritable basis, their underlying genomic architecture is rarely fully- or even mostly- explained, leading to what is sometimes called the 'missing heritability problem' (Young, 2019; Zuk et al., 2012). This is not entirely unexpected given the great complexity of genomes and phenomes, and the constraints both present for statistical power (López- Cortegano & Caballero, 2019; Uricchio, 2020).

> **This recognized challenge has led to substantial innovation- and thus variability- among investigators and studies in methods used to associate genomic and phenotypic differentiation (Burt & Munafò, 2021).**
> 
> Despite a growing number of approaches, no clear best practices exist for linking genotype to phenotype across systems. Each method has substantial limitations, and the lack of best practices adds noise to any attempt to detect underlying trends common across the tree of life (Tam et al., 2019).
